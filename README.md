# Neighborhood Map

### Project Details

Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Project 4 - 12 Jul 2018 - Mike Boyer - Boyer.Mike.E@gmail.com

Developed with:

1. [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
2. [Google Maps Api's](https://console.developers.google.com/)
3. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
4. [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/index.html)
5. [UnderscoreJS](https://underscorejs.org/)
6. [SnazzyMaps](https://snazzymaps.com/)
7. [D3.JS](https://d3js.org/)
8. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
9. [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/)

The objective of the project is to develop a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood I would like to visit. Functionality will include:
	*	Highlighted Locations
	*	Third Party Data about locations
	*	Various ways to browse content

### Requirements

* Chrome/FireFox

### Instructions (need to update):

1. To use, open maps.html

### Notes:

This project will allow the user to view my neighborhood (as a sample), or define their own in the form a template csv.

For each of these, the user will be able to view items on the map, search for nearby features, and compare nominal vs optimized routes (graphically shown via Gantt chart per Plotly.JS)

### Todo:

1. Implement KnockoutJS for not Maps API operations
2. Third Party Error-Handling - [Block sites with host file](http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-block-a-website/) / [Asynchronous Error Handling](http://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2012/12/31/asynchronous-error-handling-in-javascript/)
3. Implement full screen map (add control panel for functions to float in a corner) - Maps API should only be called once
4. Write code to display map markers, then expand the code to include locations entered by user (pop up window, or another control panel in a corner)
5. Implement list view of the locations defined
6. Add functionality from third-party APIs / [D3](http://www.smartjava.org/content/election-site-part-1-basics-knockoutjs-bootstrap-and-d3js) and [Census Data](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/popest-popproj/popest.html)
